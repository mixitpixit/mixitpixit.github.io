Sup mix, let me give you the basics. Your website is at the link above, mixitpixit.github.io, if you want to view it. To edit your homepage, edit the index.html file that is in the root directory of this repository. To make more pages, click "create new file", then at the top where it says "name your file", type: "yournewpagename/index.html", changing "yournewpagename" to..your new page name. Then that new page will be accessable at mixitpixit.github.io/newpage or wherever you create it. ALSO! If when your view your page and it says that its only half-secure or not secure, make sure you add HTTPS:// to any images that you use. HTTP:// will not work. THAT BE ALL FREN, GO NUTS.
